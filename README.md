# ML_LINEAR_REGRESSION_MODEL
Implementing regression technique and predict what would be the increase in sales given the advertisement expenditure for that month,evaluate, fine tune and reach a best model.


**Problem Statement for the Advertising data**
The dataset file consists of advertising expenditure incurred on different mediums and the overall increase in revenue that was seen during that time. For any business, advertising their products is very essential because it aids in the fast selling of a product, increases the popularity and awareness of the product in the market, which in turn, increases the overall sales for the product. But more than that, what matters for the business is that correct amount of investment should be done upon the advertisements such that it generates good return on investments otherwise it will just lead to an added expenditure.
The dataset contains statistics about the increase in sales of a product in 200 different months, together with advertising budgets in each of these months for different media channels: TV, radio and newspaper. The budget and the increase in sales is in thousands of dollars. 
You are expected to implement regression technique and predict what would be the increase in sales given the advertisement expenditure for that month. You are free to use any ML algorithms, evaluate, fine tune and reach a best model. Also derive additional/meaningful insights from the data which can help the organization to decide upon the right channels and amount of investments to be done on each media channel.
